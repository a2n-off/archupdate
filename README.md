You can choose between a dot or a label if an update is available.

Possibility to change the visual of the dot, the visual of the label and the visual of the icon.

A popup list all the available update.

And a lot of settings is provided for customizing all that !

## Installation

You can install the widget from :

* the KDE menu `Get New Widgets...`
* from the AUR, e.g. `yay -S kdeplasma-arch-update-notifier-git`

### Manual installation

#### Plasma 6

- place the `a2n.archupdate.plasmoid` folder from the latest release in `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/`
- download via [the KDE store](https://www.pling.com/p/2134470/) (install in `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/`)
- [Dl the package via the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kdeplasma-arch-update-notifier-git) (install in `/usr/share/plasma/plasmoids/`)

#### plasma 5

If you want to use this plugin with kde plasma 5 you should use:
 - ["The new era release" (v4.2)](https://github.com/bouteillerAlan/archupdate/releases/tag/v4.2.1)
 - [this version on the pling store](https://www.pling.com/p/1940819/)
 - [this version via the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kdeplasma5-arch-update-notifier-git).

**Please note that this version is not maintained since the v4.2.**

#### Dependencies and AUR helper

You need to have the following packages installed on your system **OR** to edit the settings with your prefered one:
 - [`pacman-contrib`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pacman-contrib/) is used for the list and count of the main repository.
 - [`yay`](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) is used for the list and count of the AUR repository.
 - [`konsole`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/konsole/) is used to launch the cmd for the upgrade.
 - [`kdialog`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/kdialog/) is used too, but it's not mandatory because it's used just for alerting if a cmd throw an error.

## How to have this in my system tray?

Go to the 'System Tray Settings' menu and activate it :)

*in some case you may need to log out / log in to see it in the list*

### Regarding the customization of the commands

If you have any problems after modifying the default settings (especially the cmds):

*quoting the ThinkFan repo here*

> If this program steals your car, kills your horse, smokes your dope or pees on your carpet... too bad, you're on your own.

Is up to you to double check the command you want to exec. In no case I'm responsible of anything if your system break due to your command.

The program launch the update command with `konsole -e` or the cmd that you put in the setting. So you can test your command or script with `konsole -e "my_command"` or the cmd that you put in the settings `mycmd "my_command"`.

For the update command you have a demo of each cmd just between the title of the section and the setting input.

When you update all the packages the default command is: `konsole -e (--noclose) 'yay'` where `noclose` is optional.

When you update one package the default command is: `konsole -e (--noclose) 'yay -Sy' packageName` where `noclose` is optional and `packageName` is injected from the list.

## FAQ

### Why all these options for a similar command

I like to have the opportunity to really configure everything, and to do so simply.

### Why `yay` and `pacman-contrib`

`pacman-contrib` provide `checkupdates` for counting the update for the `core` and `extra` repository AND it sync all the db automatically without the need of sudo.

I'have setup `yay` because I use EOS, but, you can use `paru` in the exact same way, you just have to update the command in the settings window.

### Why not just `yay -Qu` (or `paru -Qu`)

Because this command dosen't sync the DB at the same time so the result is wrong.

For that we need to do something like the `-S` flag before and I prefer to use `checkupdates` for that (it's made for it so...).

### Why the `Do not close at the end` option when you can just update the terminal cmd

Because it's easier for people who don't want to update the default option to switch between not closing and closing the terminal at the end of the update.

### Why the update is made with yay and not pacman

Because `yay` cover all the db (core, extra, aur, ...) and `pacman` handle only core and extra.

### I want to update the PKGBUILD or the .SRCINFO for the AUR

You have to made a pr in this repository for that : [https://github.com/bouteillerAlan/kdeplasma-arch-update-notifier-git](https://github.com/bouteillerAlan/kdeplasma-arch-update-notifier-git)
